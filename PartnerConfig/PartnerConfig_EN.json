She was met with harsh words, isolation and confinement, and emotional abuse which led to her deciding to leave to find her own freedom.\n\"Hmph! There's no chance I'll ever go back! If I'm found... then I can say goodbye to the stars and sky and I'll have to inherit the family business instead!\"\nLucy is extremely competitive.
